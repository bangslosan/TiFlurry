TiFlurry is a module for Titanium that implements the Flurry Analytics API on iOS and Android.

Unlike some other similar modules, this implementation strives for cross-platform 
API uniformity. To that end, the Android module adds a few methods to make
the API the same as the iOS API, and several Android-specific methods (less commonly used)
are not implemented.

Version 1.0 of TiFlurry integrates:
- Flurry Android SDK version 3.0.4
- Flurry iOS SDK version 4.0.6
